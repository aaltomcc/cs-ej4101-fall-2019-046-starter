### This course

I took this course to get an introduction to the DevOps world. I did have some knowledge, but I thought knowing more would help me to get a job.  I have been unemployed almost five years now. My earlier work career was basically C/C++ programming and those kind of jobs are not so common anymore in Finland. Finding a job has been really difficult. Usually my work experience is appreciated in the job interviews, but my general knowledge about latest software tools and methods feels outdated. Also I haven't had so much work experience in actual customer projects, only on training tasks. So, to learn something totally new and to update my skills, I decided to apply to this Piece of Work program by TE-palvelut and University of Tampere. I was lucky and I got chosen. When I was browsing the available courses of FiTech, I noticed this DevOps course. I have had couple of courses in using some DevOps tools, like Docker and Vagrant. However, I didn’t have so much knowledge about the philosophy of DevOps. That’s why I choose this course and I expected to learn why DevOps is so popular nowadays. I also expected to learn more about GIT, which is very common version control system in every company. I was also hoping that I could find time to focus on this course same time when I started a training period in a software testing company. The concept of web course was kind of new for me. When I studied at the university back in 90’s, there weren’t any web courses. It was a little bit worrying and I wasn’t so sure if I could concentrate enough.


### Learned

Maybe this starter project was little bit too easy for me. I started to follow the Hello World example from the GitHub webpage. I learned how to create a branch, how to add new files and how to make commits. Then I learned also how to make a pull requests and merges. But then I thought that I should also learn how to use Git from command line. After all that is something very common in many real software projects. There was some configuration erros in my macOS laptop, so I decided to use my Linux desktop computer. I followed the process explained in the Pro GIT book. I managed to clone the reposity easily and also the commit was pretty easy. I did had some problems with the final git push, but that was because my email settings were incorrect in the GitHub. Anyway it was more important to me refresh my GIT routines than learn how to write Markdown syntax.
 
Another very useful learning was about the Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment pipelines. I think those are the key elements of the whole DevOps system. The idea is to do everything faster in cycles, not in large batches like in traditional waterfall model. If and when I want to have a permanent job in test automation, I need to learn how to build continuos integration, delivery and deployment to my test automation pipeline. It was also useful to learn how correct measurements are important in feedback loops. Customer should always get relevant data from the system.

And finally I will mention the culture. As being a little bit older and hopefully experienced software designer and tester, all this small things about culture and diversity have become more important. My point of view is not only technical. Of course using correct tools and streamlined processes is something you must consider, but you also need to think about the motivation. When the team can trust to each other and to the company culture, then all problems can be solved in somehow organized way.
